Step-by-Step: Use the Blackbook to Train a Better Detection Model

---

#### **1. Understand What the Blackbook Contains**

If **Blackbook** refers to a list or dataset (YARA rules, signatures, strings, keywords, etc.):

* Open the **Blackbook** file (maybe a `.txt`, `.csv`, `.json`, or `.yara` file).
* Identify what kind of **features** or **rules** it contains (e.g., JavaScript in PDF, suspicious keywords, embedded files).

> Example:
> If it lists entries like `"/JS"`, `"/Launch"`, `"AA"` etc., these are potential malicious indicators.

---

#### **2. Extract Features From the Blackbook**

Update your `part 2.py` script to:

* Load Blackbook rules.
* Scan PDF files for these features.
* Count how many indicators are matched.

```python
def load_blackbook(file_path):
    with open(file_path, "r") as f:
        return [line.strip() for line in f if line.strip()]

def extract_blackbook_features(pdf_content, blackbook_rules):
    return [rule for rule in blackbook_rules if rule in pdf_content]
```

---

#### **3. Build a Dataset (if not already)**

Youâ€™ll need labeled PDFs:

* **Malicious PDFs** (e.g., from VirusShare, Contagio, or your own samples).
* **Benign PDFs** (e.g., books, papers).

For each PDF:

* Extract features (Blackbook hits, JavaScript, embedded files, etc.).
* Label as 1 (malicious) or 0 (benign).

Save this as a `.csv`:

```csv
js_count,launch_count,obj_count,blackbook_hit_count,label
3,1,12,5,1
0,0,10,0,0
```

---

#### **4. Train a Machine Learning Model**

Use **scikit-learn**:

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import pandas as pd

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv('pdf_dataset.csv')
X = df.drop('label', axis=1)
y = df['label']

# Split and train
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
clf = RandomForestClassifier()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
print("Accuracy:", clf.score(X_test, y_test))
```

---

#### **5. Use the Model in `part 2.py`**

* Extract features from the input PDF as you did during training.
* Load your trained model (`joblib` or `pickle`) and predict.

```python
import joblib

model = joblib.load("pdf_detector_model.pkl")
features = [js_count, launch_count, obj_count, blackbook_hit_count]
result = model.predict([features])
print("Malicious" if result[0] == 1 else "Benign")
```

---

#### **6. Improve Detection Further**

* Add more **obfuscation checks** (base64, hex encoding).
* Use **PDF libraries** like `pdfminer.six` or `PyMuPDF` for deep extraction.
* Integrate **Blackbook hits as weights** or priority features.
